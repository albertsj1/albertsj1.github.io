## Project Overview

Designed and implemented a production-ready Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service) platform to support a containerized microservices architecture migration. The platform includes automated scaling, service mesh integration, and streamlined deployment processes using AWS native services.

## Technical Implementation

### ECS Cluster Architecture

- **Multi-AZ ECS cluster** with EC2 and Fargate launch types
- **Auto Scaling Groups** for dynamic capacity management
- **Application Load Balancer** integration for traffic distribution
- **VPC networking** with private subnets and NAT gateways

### Key Features

- **ECS Service Auto Scaling** based on CloudWatch metrics
- **Service Discovery** using AWS Cloud Map
- **Blue/Green deployments** with AWS CodeDeploy
- **Infrastructure as Code** with CloudFormation and CDK

### Monitoring & Observability

- **CloudWatch Container Insights** for comprehensive monitoring
- **AWS X-Ray** for distributed tracing across services
- **ELK Stack on ECS** for centralized logging
- **Custom CloudWatch dashboards** for operational visibility

### Security & Compliance

- **IAM task roles** for fine-grained service permissions
- **AWS Secrets Manager** integration for secure credential management
- **VPC security groups** and NACLs for network isolation
- **Container image scanning** with Amazon ECR

## Results

- **45% improvement** in deployment speed compared to previous solution
- **99.95% uptime** achieved across all containerized services
- **30% reduction** in infrastructure costs through Fargate optimization
- **Enhanced security** with AWS native security services integration

The ECS platform now supports over 25 containerized microservices with seamless auto-scaling, zero-downtime deployments, and comprehensive observability across the entire container ecosystem.
