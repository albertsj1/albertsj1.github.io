## Project Overview

Led the redesign of legacy CI/CD pipelines to improve deployment speed, reliability, and security. The project involved migrating from Jenkins-based workflows to modern GitHub Actions with AWS integration.

## Key Technologies

- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions, AWS CodeBuild, AWS CodeDeploy
- **Containerization**: Docker, Amazon ECR
- **Infrastructure**: AWS ECS, Lambda, API Gateway
- **Testing**: Jest, Cypress, SonarQube
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch, Datadog

## Implementation Strategy

### Pipeline Architecture

Designed a multi-stage pipeline architecture with automated testing, security scanning, and progressive deployment strategies. Each stage included comprehensive validation and rollback capabilities.

### Performance Optimization

- Implemented parallel job execution
- Optimized Docker layer caching
- Integrated artifact management with Amazon ECR
- Reduced build times from 25 minutes to 10 minutes

### Security Integration

- Automated vulnerability scanning with Snyk
- Integrated SAST/DAST security testing
- Implemented secrets management with AWS Secrets Manager
- Added compliance checks and audit logging

## Key Achievements

- **60% reduction** in deployment time
- **99.5% deployment success rate**
- **Zero production incidents** from faulty deployments
- **Automated rollback** capabilities implemented
- **Enhanced security** with automated scanning

The optimized pipeline now supports multiple deployment strategies including blue-green and canary deployments, with comprehensive monitoring and alerting throughout the entire process.
